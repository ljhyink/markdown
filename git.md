### Git Workflow <h3> 
---------------------
There is a main process git follows that makes it easy to work, and great for organization. This process includes main repositories, branches, and committing (and committing often).
#### Main <h4>
Creating a main repository is the first step in the git workfow, solidifying that you have somewhere to save all of your changes to. 
Based off of this repository, you can create separate areas to save work, called branches.
#### Branches <h4>
Branches are based off of the main repository, holding files or images, among other things. With a branch, it's easier to keep track of your work and keep organized.
When you are ready to save and move on, you need to "commit" these changes to the branch.
#### Committing <h4>
Committing changes should be done often, and when you hit "commit", this adds your changes to the branch you were working on, and merges this branch back with the main repository, leaving your work ready to go.
### Good Documentation <h3>
---------------------------
Having good documentation while working with git is important for many reasons, although this is mainly for organization, and to avoid silly mistakes. 
For example, creating useful names for your branches and repositories, so as not to get them confused with other projects, and making sure you don't merge too soon with a pull request. 
Having good documentation allows you to keep each area of git separate and to not make errors.
